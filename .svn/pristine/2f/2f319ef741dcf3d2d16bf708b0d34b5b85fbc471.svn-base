== Scripts for generating COMPSs auxiliar configuration files ==


=== Usage ===
	./generate_all.sh <projectFilePath> <resourcesFilePath> <remoteUser> <Worker1>...<WorkerN>


=== Warnings ===
	- The <projectFilePath> will be overwritten
	- The <resourcesFilePath> will be overwritten
	- You will be prompted for several ssh passwords if the ssh is not configured passwordless between the Master and the worker machines


=== Known Limitations ===
	- The remote user must be the same in all the Workers
	- We perform 7 SSH commands per worker
	- The commands are only tested on RPM based machines
	- The files must always be completely generated (no append mode)


=== Execution Example ===
 - Without user login
	./generate_all.sh ./project.xml ./resources.xml "" COMPSsWorker01 COMPSsWorker02

 - With user login
	./generate_all.sh ./project.xml ./resources.xml myUserName COMPSsWorker01 COMPSsWorker02
