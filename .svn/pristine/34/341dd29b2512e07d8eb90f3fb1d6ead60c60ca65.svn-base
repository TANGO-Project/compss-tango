 COMP SUPERSCALAR FRAMEWORK
-----------------------------

COMP Superscalar (COMPSs) is a programming model which aims to ease the development of applications for distributed infrastructures,
such as Clusters, Grids and Clouds. COMP superscalar also features a runtime system that exploits the inherent parallelism of 
applications at execution time.


Release number: 2.2 Camellia
Release date: November-2017
-------------------------------
New features:
        * Runtime:
                - Support Elasticity in SLURM-managed clusters
                - Support for Elasticity with Singularity containers
                - Integration of Decaf flows as COMPSs tasks
                - Changed integratedtoolkit packages by es.bsc.compss (requires changes in Java application codes)

        * Python:
                - Support for Decaf applications as tasks
                - External decorators (MPI, Binary, Decaf, etc.) extended with streams and prefixes support
                - Added support for applications that use the argparse library
                - Added support for dictionary unrolling on task call

        * C:
                - Persistent worker in C-binding (enabled with persistent_worker_c=true)            
                - Inter-task object cache 
                - Support for object methods as tasks
                - Added support applications with threads in master code

Improvements:
        - Integration with Jupyter-notebook improved
        - Improved cleanup - Unused files removal
        - Several bug fixes

Known Limitations:
        - Tasks that invoke Numpy and MKL may experience issues if tasks use a different number of MKL threads. This is due to
          the fact that MKL reuses threads in the different calls and it does not change the number of threads from one call to another.
