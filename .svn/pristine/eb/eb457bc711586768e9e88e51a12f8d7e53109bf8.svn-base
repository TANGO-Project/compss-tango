== Build instructions ==
mvn -U clean install                         #Compiles all the application's sources
                                        
  ATTENTION: This step is done automatically by running the ./scritps/main script


== Execution instructions ==
          !!! ATTENTION: CONFIGURATION FILES NEED TO BE PERSONALIZED !!!
                         (SEE Usage-Configuration_files document)

* FOR CLOUD EXECUTION ON JENKINS:
 ./scripts/main "cloud_jenkins"                 #Executes all tests on all distributions

* FOR CLOUD EXECUTION FOR DEVELOPPERS THROUGH BSCGRID20:
 ./scripts/main cloud cloud.cfg                 #Executes all cloud tests
 ./scripts/main cloud_X cloud.cfg               #Executes test cloud number X

* FOR CLOUD EXECUTION FOR DEVELOPPERS THROUGH VPN
 ./scripts/main cloudvpn cloudvpn.cfg           #Executes all cloud tests
 ./scripts/main cloudvpn_X cloudvpn.cfg         #Executes test cloud number X
   ATTENTION: Cloud test number 1 (FaultTolerance) cannot be tested through this mode !!

* FOR LOCAL EXECUTION:
  ./scripts/main local local.cfg                #Executes all tests on current COMPSs
  ./scripts/main local_X local.cfg              #Executes test number X on current COMPSs

* FOR DEVELOPPEMENT TESTS EXECUTION:
./scripts/main devel_FeatureName devel_FN.cfg   #Executes developpement tests on current COMPSs

 NOTE: If your configuration file is stored in ./configurations you can call it only using its name but if it's stored in another location you need to use the absolute path to it.


== Result Check instructions ==
* FOR CLOUD EXECUTION ON JENKINS:
    Jenkins provides and instense log file.
    However, to have more information about specific errors check $WORKSPACE/logs folder.

* FOR CLOUD EXECUTION FOR DEVELOPPERS:
    Check the output printed by the execution
    For further information check $log_folder folder (defined on your configuration file)

* FOR LOCAL EXECUTION:
    Check ~/${target_base_dir}/logs folder.

* FOR DEVELOPMENT TESTS EXECUTION:
    Check ~/${target_base_dir}/logs folder.


== !!!!!!!!! READ CAREFULLY !!!!!!!!!!!!! ==
1. The ./scripts/main scripts executes all the needed steps to compile, deploy, run and store logs needed. DO NOT RUN ANY OTHER SCRIPT.
2. When all tests are finished a result table is shown.
3. You can find more information about the scpecific workflow of each test at:
