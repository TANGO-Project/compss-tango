This benchmark tests mergesort-like COMPSs apps. 
In this case, we have (files/objects) and (in/inout).

In all cases, the object that's modified is the left one.
For example, if we have a merge of objects 0 and 4, the 0 will be passed to the next merge round, while the 4 is discarded. 

So the program will only create the top most row objects, and will pass them down using merges.
