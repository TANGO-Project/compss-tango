======================================
	PyCOMPSs PYPI DISTRIBUTABLE
======================================

This README contains information about the PIP distributable creation process.

It is assumed that this README is placed (alongside with buildpip and the whole PyCOMPSsResources
directory) in trunk/builders/specs/pip and that you have a trunk version consistent with
the COMPS_VERSION.tar.gz supercomputer distributable that is going to be downloaded
(this will be explained in detail later).

If you want to install PyCOMPSs via distutils and/or PIP then you must have all the
PyCOMPSs dependencies satisfied.
You must also have the JAVA_HOME environment variable defined.

It is encouraged to read all sections of this README before proceeding on any modification or
action on this package.


======================================
	CREATING THE DISTRIBUTABLE
======================================

The PyPI distributable can be created with the following command:
	sudo -E ./buildpip $VERSION
Where $VERSION contains the desired target version. For example, if
you want to create a distributable for the 2.0.rc1337 version then
the following command should be executed:
	sudo -E ./buildpip 2.0.rc1337

This will create the following files and directories:
	- A PyCOMPSs directory in /trunk/builders/packages/pip.
	  This directory contains the scripts and files necessary to
	  install PyCOMPSs and PyPyCOMPSs via distutils and/or PIP.

	- A pycompss-rc1337.tar.gz file in /trunk/builders/packages/pip/PyCOMPSs/dist
	  This .tar.gz contains the whole PyCOMPSs directory (except for the dist folder).
	  This file is useful for testing. For example, if you type
	  sudo -E python -m pip install pycompss-rc1337.tar.gz -v
	  pip will try to install PyCOMPSs from this .tar.gz 



======================================
	INSTALLING PyCOMPSs
======================================

In order to install PyCOMPSs from a distributable you must:
	- Have all COMPSs dependencies satisfied.
	  These dependencies can be found on the COMPSs installation manual,
	  section 2.2. The manual can be found at http://compss.bsc.es/releases/compss/2.0/docs/COMPSs_Installation_Manual.pdf?tracked=true
	- Have JAVA_HOME properly defined. As a reminder, you must have a valid JDK installed (not JRE) and your
	  JAVA_HOME must point to that path.

A PyCOMPSs distributable can be installed in any of the following ways:
	- From a .tar.gz distributable. Let's assume you have a pycompss-$VERSION.tar.gz
	  created from the buildpip script. Then the following command: 
		sudo -E python -m pip install pycompss-$VERSION.tar.gz
	  Will install PyCOMPSs in your site-packages.

	- From a pyPI repository (this will be clarified later). For example, if you
	  type
		sudo -E python -m pip install pycompss
	  The latest PyCOMPSs version that was released on the live PyPI repository will be
	  downloaded and installed.

	- From the PyCOMPSs folder. The PyCOMPSs folder contains the very same files as
	  the dist/pycompss-$VERSION.tar.gz (except for the tgz itself!).
	  You can install PyCOMPSs from this folder with
		python setup.py install

PyCOMPSs needs some environment variables. The pip PyCOMPSs installer leaves an script in
/etc/profile.d/compss.sh . You must restart your session or source the script.

WARNING:
	Due to the unusual nature of this installation process, some errors may not stop the
	installation, leading to incomplete, non-functional builds.
	For this reason, it is recommended to run the pip install command with the flag -v (verbose).
	It is also recommended to test PyCOMPSs installations when new versions or changes are made
	and to redirect the standard output and the standard error to some files.


======================================
	UNINSTALLING PyCOMPSs
======================================

PyCOMPSs can be uninstalled (if it was previously installed with distutils and/or PIP) with the following
command:
	sudo -E python -m pip uninstall pycompss
	sudo bash /etc/profile.d/compss.sh


======================================
	UPLOADING A DISTRIBUTABLE
======================================

*** PLEASE, READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY ***

It is recommended to read this guide about PIP packages and it is encouraged to
have some experience with it (for example, create small, dummy packages and upload 
them to the test repository):
	http://peterdowns.com/posts/first-time-with-pypi.html

A PyCOMPSs distributable can be uploaded to a repository and then be downloadable and
installable by anyone with python and pip.

In order to upload a PyPI package the following command must be executed:
	python setup.py sdist upload -r pyPI_URL

Usually pyPI_URL is one of these two:
	- pyPI test repository: https://testpypi.python.org/pypi
	- pyPI live repository: https://pypi.python.org/pypi

You must have proper login credentials defined on your ~/.pypirc
file. Please, see the aforementioned tutorial for a proper pypirc
example

The login credentials are available at the wiki 

WARNING: Be very careful when uploading PyCOMPSs distributables on pyPI.
pyPI does not allow to re-upload a .tar.gz distributable for the same release. 
Upload only well-tested installables!

README:
	- This file.

buildpip:
	- Main script. sudo -E ./buildpip VERSION will create a PIP distributable named
	  PyCOMPSs-${PyCOMPSs_VERSION}.tar.gz in trunk/builders/packages/pip/PyCOMPSs/dist/ 
	  Example: sudo -E ./buildpip 2.0 will create a PyCOMPSs-2.0.tar.gz

PyCOMPSsResources/backend.py:
	- Auxiliary script which downloads and installs PyCOMPSs in the site-packages folder.
	  It also places an script in /etc/profile.d/PyCOMPSs.sh which is equivalent to the
	  PyCOMPSsenv script in the supercomputers installable (see PyCOMPSsenv later in this
	  list).

PyCOMPSsResources/PyCOMPSsenv:
	- A Bash script template that it is intended to be put in the profile.d directory.
	  It sets some environment variables that are needed by PyCOMPSs. If PyCOMPSs is no longer listed
	  in the installed PIP packages, then this script, when executed as root, will delete all the
	  files related to PyCOMPSs, including the file itself.

PyCOMPSsResources/MANIFEST.in:
	- A distutils manifest. This will determine which files will be included in
	  the Python distributables. See https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/commandref.html
	  for more clarification on how this file works.

PyCOMPSsResources/README.txt:
	- An user-oriented README file.

PyCOMPSsResources/setup.py:
	- Pip installable main script. This installs PyCOMPSs and PyCOMPSs.

PyCOMPSsResources/url:
	- Repository from the PyCOMPSs installable will be downloaded. The install script will try to
	  download and untar a PyCOMPSs_$VERSION.tar.gz from that URL. There are also some additional url_
	  files. These contain other possible urls that can be used for debugging purposes.
	  For example, one may start a local server, put there a customized pycompss_$VERSION.tar.gz file
	  and test the installer locally with this new distribution.

An additional file named VERSION.txt will be created (and NOT deleted) by the buildpip script.
A manual modification of this file will have no effect on future PIP distributable builds
since it will be automatically replaced by a new one.
